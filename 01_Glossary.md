## MLOps or ML Ops 
```
MLOps or ML Ops is 
a set of practices 
that aims to deploy and maintain 
machine learning models 
in production reliably and efficiently.

The word is a compound of 
"machine learning" and 
the continuous development practice of DevOps 
in the software field.

Machine learning models are tested and developed in isolated experimental systems. 

When an algorithm is ready to be launched, 
MLOps is practiced between Data Scientists, DevOps, and Machine Learning engineers 
to transition the algorithm to production systems.


Similar to DevOps or DataOps approaches, 
MLOps seeks to increase automation and 
improve the quality of production models, 
while also focusing on 
	business and regulatory requirements.
